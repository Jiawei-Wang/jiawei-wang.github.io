        I adopted Chica from Everett animal shelter in 2021 and she has seen all the ups and downs<br>
        that I have gone through as a software engineer. More importantly, she has been through all <br>
        these ups and downs with me as a loyal companion and provided tremendous support.<br>
        She is not a pet, she is a huge part of my heart.<br>
